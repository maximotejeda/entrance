* Entrance Service
This service is intended as a reverse proxy for various services im thinking to develop,
some in *Go* others on *Dart/Flutter* the main goal of the service is to be easy to manage
the request that will end hitting the distinct services behind the proxy.

** The Router
is a cutom one made from old code from a few books i barely remember so i expect to improve
as i move forward in the project, trying to make use of others libraries made by me, this
one will make use of the standard library to manage all the task.

Regexp: is used to compare API Verbs and Paths and match them to handlers

** Plans
implement other services apart from the only one available right now AUTH
